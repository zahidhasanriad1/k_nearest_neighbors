# k_nearest_neighbors
 K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a versatile machine learning algorithm for classification and regression, relying on nearby data points to make predictions. It's easy to understand but can be sensitive to the choice of K and computationally demanding for large datasets. K-NN finds applications in recommendation systems, image recognition, and more
